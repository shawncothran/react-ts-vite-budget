## Design Challenge Rationale
For each task, please give a brief description of your process, your reasoning used to make the changes and how you feel the change benefits the overall app. We work collaboratively at Planning Center, so being able to communicate the intent, purpose or motivation of your change is often just as important as the code itself!

### Task 1: Update form accessibility
This task mostly aims to make all the user interaction accessible via keyboard. I refactored the Wallet form to improve accessibility and semantics. Replaced divs with proper elements like `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and `<button>`, added aria-pressed and focus styles for keyboard and screen reader support, and normalized typography. If this was production code, I'd focus on adding form validation and error messaging for a more robust user experience.
